# Lofi
**What is Lofi?**

Lofi is a collection of scripts made my me, I make these scripts for fun and the code may not be 100% the best. 

**Scripts included in this pack**

	└ [Lofi] Edge+.lua
		└ Edge+ is a lua that automatically bases your anti-aim towards the nearest wall
		└ Edge+ currently only goes in the forward direction.
	└ [Lofi] Crosshair.lua
		└ This lua shows you where your real angle is in a circle, it also shows you when you are onshotting and if double-tap is enabled.
		└ I also added a indicator that shows if you use KKKace's At-Targets lua. The indicator will blink if it is not loaded.
	└ [Lofi] Hitmarker.lua
		└ This lua shows a little hitmarker around your crosshair when you hit someone, this also appears when you damage users with grenades.
	└ [Lofi] Quick Peek Beta.lua
		└ This lua makes is so when the keybind is pressed, a circle  will appear on the position you were when you pressed the key.
